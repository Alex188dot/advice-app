# Advice App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and was inspired by 
The Ultimate React Course 2023: React, Redux & More on Udemy by Jonas Schmedtmann.

This is a simple React app that fetches and displays random pieces of advice from the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/).
See example output below:
